# An Epigenetic Gene's Role on Vascular Calcification
  
I am presenting a sample of the results I acquired throughout my time at the Victor Chang Research Institute as a research assistant in the Vascular Epigenetics Lab. These results are from a project I lead which involved looking at the role and mechanism of a gene we are very interested in on a vascular disease called Vascular Calcification.  

For the sake of privacy I have ommitted labels and legends from the figures as this work is not published yet. However, we are currently wrapping up experiments and are hoping to have the paper ready to publish.
