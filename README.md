# An Epigenetic Gene's Role on Vascular Calcification
  
I am presenting a __sample__ of the results I acquired throughout my time at the Victor Chang Research Institute as a research assistant. These results are from a project I lead which involved looking at the role and mechanism of a gene we are very interested in on a vascular disease called Vascular Calcification.  

For the sake of privacy I have ommitted labels and legends from the figures as this work is not published yet. However, we are currently wrapping up experiments and are hoping to have the paper ready to publish.  

The data was analysed through Excel and GraphPad prism. The data was visualised using GraphPad Prism

## Results
### Sample Figure 1

The pink stain represents the level of calcification built up onto the aorta. The entire figure can be summarised with the point that when our gene of interest is knocked out (KO) the progression of calcification is more severe. We also see an increase in bone specific markers in our gene KO vessels. This shows that the gene plays a role in vascular calcification.  
__The asterix represents there is a statistically significant difference between the variables. The more asterix the higher the significance.__

This is the functional part of our study where I measured the stiffness of the vessels using a myograph. The myograph measures the inner and outer diamater at increasing pressures. We then use these measurements to tell us about the intrinsic properties of the vessel, such as vessel stiffness by using Young's elastic modulus equation. We also used an EVG stain to visualise the elastin in our vessels, which is an extra cellular matrix protein that is very important for vessel contractility and elasticity. 
To summarise, here we see that our GENE KO leads to reduced vessel functionality.
